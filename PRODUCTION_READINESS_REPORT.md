## üü° Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

### 1. Bundle Size Optimization
**Issue**: Main bundle exceeds 500KB (currently 538KB)
**Impact**: Slower initial load on slow connections
**Solution**:
- Implement code splitting for Firebase modules
- Lazy load game modes
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical features

### 2. TypeScript Strictness
**Issue**: TypeScript strict mode disabled
**Impact**: Potential runtime errors
**Solution**:
- Enable strict mode gradually
- Add proper type definitions
- Remove 'any' types where possible

### 3. Incomplete Method Implementations
**Issue**: Several game engine methods stubbed (validateMove, applyMove, etc.)
**Impact**: Some features may not work fully
**Solution**:
- Complete GameEngine integration
- Implement missing SmartAI methods
- Add proper move validation
