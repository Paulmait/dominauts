## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX IMMEDIATELY

### 1. Missing Environment Variables in Vercel
**Impact: HIGH - App won't function properly**

You MUST add these to Vercel Dashboard immediately:
```bash
# Database Connection (CRITICAL)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# App Configuration (CRITICAL)
VITE_APP_URL=https://dominauts.com
NODE_ENV=production

# Authentication (CRITICAL)
JWT_SECRET=(generate 32+ char secret)
```

### 2. Database Connection Issues
**Current State:** No active database connection
**Solution:**
1. Set up Supabase project at https://supabase.com
2. Add connection strings to Vercel
3. Initialize database schema with provided SQL files

### 3. Missing Analytics & Error Tracking
**Risk:** Can't track user behavior or errors in production
```bash
# Add immediately:
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID  # Google Analytics
VITE_SENTRY_DSN        # Error tracking
```
